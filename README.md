# Basic OpenAI Python Example

This is an example setup for using the OpenAI API with Python and the `requests` library. Using the `openai` Python package is recommended, but this example is for those who prefer to use `requests` directly.

## Setting the Environment Variable

| OS/Shell | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Windows CMD | `set OPENAI_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'` |
| Windows PowerShell | `$Env:OPENAI_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'` |
| Linux (bash) | `export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'` |

Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key.

After setting the environment variable, you can run the Python script in the same terminal session.
